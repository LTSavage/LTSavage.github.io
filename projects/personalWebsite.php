                    <h3>Deciding The Colour Scheme</h3>
                    <p>When deciding the colour scheme the decision came down to my favourite colours and those which aren&#39;t too harsh on a website. This ends up being grey and orange. I intend to use grey for text and orange to accent features</p>

                    <h3>Coming up with the layout</h3>
                    <p>I spent a while deciding how to layout my options, and I liked the idea of a navigation bar. I couldn&#39;t initally decide whether I wanted minimalist or to show off my skills with intricate menus with animations. I liked the idea of both, but pulling them off together but I am well aware that would be a challenge (One that I am probably not capable of). As in the picture, I wanted to have boxes with my individual projects `in them. This needed to be modular to add new projects as I progress with the potential of moving the projects off the homepage after so many more projects come along to improve performance. The page also needed to be responsive to be able to be viewed on multiple devices such as windows&frasl;phone&frasl;macOS. This design allows the boxes to be 2 columns wide on displays that support it, and those that do not it is 1 column wide. </p>
